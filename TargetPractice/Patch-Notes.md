Before 28 march

Initial ideas: Increase the border size, idea got discarded cause it make confusion between the target hitbox and it's actual size.

Change the color of the target.

Changes to code:

Remove outline
Current target to red
Next target to green
If the current target is equal to the next target to blue

28 march

User feedback:
Colours are confusing and non-intuitive

- Blue is not a good colour to indicate a double-click
- Users started clicking on green instead of red
  Low accuracy rates
- Users are missing clicks because they think the pointer is on the target
- There is no feedback if you hit/miss a target
  High time between target hits
- Users are taking on average 750ms to move between targets

Aim assist (not doable)

- [x] Add an arrow from target to target (Cancelled)
- [x] Add highlight

Changes to make:

- [x] Change crosshair (Cancelled)
- [x] Add a hit/miss message
- [x] Add sound

The target is always at the new circle from the user cursor.
We implemented that.

- [x] Add snapping

We also implemented 2 versions of the project:
