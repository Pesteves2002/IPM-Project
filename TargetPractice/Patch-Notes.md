Before 28 march

Initial ideas:  Increase the border size, idea got discarded cause it make confusion between the target hitbox and it's actual size.

Change the color of the target.

Changes to code:

Remove outline
Current target to red
Next target to green
If the current target is equal to the next target to blue



28 march

User feedback:
Colours are confusing and non-intuitive
- Blue is not a good colour to indicate a double-click
- Users started clicking on green instead of red
Low accuracy rates
- Users are missing clicks because they think the pointer is on the target
- There is no feedback if you hit/miss a target
High time between target hits
- Users are taking on average 750ms to move between targets
